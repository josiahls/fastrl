DO NOT EDIT! -->\n\n\n> Basic Agent classes for handling models and actions. Details, please ref `basic_train`\n\nThere is an important difference between `Learner`'s, `nn.Module`'s, and `Agent`'s. \n\n`Learners`:\n- Ref `basic_train`\n\n`nn.Module`:\n- Contain only `pytorch` related code.\n- Function as the brain of any of these agents and are the objects to be optimized.\n- Are highly portable, however for runtime usage are too \"dumb\" or simple to be practical. If by themselves, extra code needs to wrap them to handle environments.\n\n`Agent` (`agent_core`):\n- Contain a `nn.Module` and a limited number of `fastrl` objects. Unlike `nn.Module`, these can maintain a state.\n- Function as the interface between the `nn.Module` and the environments. They have 2 goals:\n    - Convert states into something the `nn.Module` can interpret.\n    - Modify the `nn.Module` output (actions) for randomized exploration.\n- Designed to be highly portable only requiring `basic_agents` as a dependency. These should allow for easily saving, and using in environments where `fastrl` might not necessarily be installed.\n"},"formats":{"html":{"execute":{"fig-width":7,"fig-height":5,"fig-format":"retina","fig-dpi":96,"df-print":"default","error":false,"eval":true,"cache":null,"freeze":false,"echo":true,"output":true,"warning":true,"include":true,"keep-md":false,"keep-ipynb":false,"ipynb":null,"enabled":false,"daemon":null,"daemon-restart":false,"debug":false,"ipynb-filters":["nbdev_filter"],"engine":"jupyter"},"render":{"keep-tex":false,"keep-yaml":false,"keep-source":false,"keep-hidden":false,"prefer-html":false,"output-divs":true,"output-ext":"html","fig-align":"default","fig-pos":null,"fig-env":null,"code-fold":"none","code-overflow":"scroll","code-link":false,"code-line-numbers":false,"code-tools":false,"tbl-colwidths":"auto","merge-includes":true,"latex-auto-mk":true,"latex-auto-install":true,"latex-clean":true,"latex-max-runs":10,"latex-makeindex":"makeindex","latex-makeindex-opts":[],"latex-tlmgr-opts":[],"latex-input-paths":[],"latex-output-dir":null,"link-external-icon":false,"link-external-newwindow":false,"self-contained-math":false,"format-resources":[]},"pandoc":{"standalone":true,"wrap":"none","default-image-extension":"png","to":"html","css":["styles.css"],"toc":true,"toc-depth":4,"output-file":"03_basic_agents.html"},"language":{},"metadata":{"lang":"en","fig-responsive":true,"quarto-version":"1.1.141","theme":"cosmo","description":"Methods of exploratively selecting actions based on a model state input.","title":"Basic Action Selection"},"extensions":{"book":{"multiFile":true}}}}}
