DO NOT EDIT! -->\n\nIt is important to note that A2C without extra augmentation will lose memoiry very quickly. If it succeeds at 200+ reward, it will eventually **forget** what strategies got it there and you will see the graph for rewards drop back down. It is recommended to use some kind of early stopping for rewards. The more fun solution would be expermenting with ways to keep the agent stable possibly by keeping samples that it deemed as \"important\".\n"},"formats":{"html":{"execute":{"fig-width":7,"fig-height":5,"fig-format":"retina","fig-dpi":96,"df-print":"default","error":false,"eval":true,"cache":null,"freeze":false,"echo":true,"output":true,"warning":true,"include":true,"keep-md":false,"keep-ipynb":false,"ipynb":null,"enabled":false,"daemon":null,"daemon-restart":false,"debug":false,"ipynb-filters":["nbdev_filter"],"engine":"jupyter"},"render":{"keep-tex":false,"keep-yaml":false,"keep-source":false,"keep-hidden":false,"prefer-html":false,"output-divs":true,"output-ext":"html","fig-align":"default","fig-pos":null,"fig-env":null,"code-fold":"none","code-overflow":"scroll","code-link":false,"code-line-numbers":false,"code-tools":false,"tbl-colwidths":"auto","merge-includes":true,"latex-auto-mk":true,"latex-auto-install":true,"latex-clean":true,"latex-max-runs":10,"latex-makeindex":"makeindex","latex-makeindex-opts":[],"latex-tlmgr-opts":[],"latex-input-paths":[],"latex-output-dir":null,"link-external-icon":false,"link-external-newwindow":false,"self-contained-math":false,"format-resources":[]},"pandoc":{"standalone":true,"wrap":"none","default-image-extension":"png","to":"html","css":["styles.css"],"toc":true,"toc-depth":4,"output-file":"16_actorcritic.a2c.html"},"language":{},"metadata":{"lang":"en","fig-responsive":true,"quarto-version":"1.1.141","theme":"cosmo","description":"Synchronous Actor Critic","title":"A2C"},"extensions":{"book":{"multiFile":true}}}}}
